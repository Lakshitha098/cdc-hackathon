# Climate Change: Analyzing Trends and Developing Sustainable Solutions

## Overview

"Climate Change: Analyzing Trends and Developing Sustainable Solutions" is a web application designed to analyze climate change data and provide insights into environmental trends. The app presents data-driven visualizations, trends over time, and sustainable solutions to address climate challenges. It aims to raise awareness about climate change and foster better decision-making for sustainable practices.

## Features

- **Analyze Climate Trends**: Explore visualizations of climate change data over the years, including temperature changes, CO2 emissions, and more.
- **Sustainable Solutions**: Discover effective solutions to combat climate change, including renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs that allow users to interact with climate data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive navigation for users of all technical backgrounds.
- **Real-Time Data**: The app pulls up-to-date data from reliable climate databases to present accurate trends and forecasts.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
  - Data visualization libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js)
- **Backend** (optional for data processing):
  - Python (Flask/Django for server-side processing, if required)
  - Node.js (for fetching and serving data)
- **APIs**:
  - Climate data APIs (e.g., NASA, NOAA, World Bank)
- **Datasource** :
  - NASA
  - IPCC
  - NOAA

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-change-analysis.git
    cd climate-change-analysis
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - If using **Node.js** for the backend:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - If using **Python**:
